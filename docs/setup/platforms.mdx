title: Platform support
description: ONNX Runtime, and by extension `ort`, supports a wide variety of platforms. For most desktop users, pre-built binaries are available, so setting up `ort` is as simple as adding it to your `Cargo.toml`!
---

Here are the supported platforms and binary availability status, as of v2.0.

* 🟢 - Supported. Dynamic & static binaries provided by pyke.
* 🔷 - Supported. Static binaries provided by pyke.
* ⭕ - Supported. Precompiled binaries not available.
* ❌ - Not supported.

| Platform | x86 | x86-64 | ARMv7 | ARM64 | WASM32 |
|:-------- |:------- |:------ |:------ |:------ |:------ |
| **Windows** | ⭕ | 🟢 | ⭕ | 🔷 | ❌ |
| **Linux** | ⭕ | 🟢 | ⭕ | 🔷 | ❌ |
| **macOS** | ❌ | 🔷 | ❌ | 🔷 | ❌ |
| **iOS** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⭕ | ❌ |
| **Android** | ❌ | ❌ | ⭕ | ⭕ | ❌ |
| **Web** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔷 |

If your platform is marked as 🟢 or 🔷, you're in luck! Almost no setup will be required to get `ort` up and running. For platforms marked as ⭕, you'll need to [compile ONNX Runtime from source](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/).

<Note>Certain execution providers may not have binaries available. You can check EP binary support in the [execution providers](/perf/execution-providers) documentation.</Note>
