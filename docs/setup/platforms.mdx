title: Platform support
description: ONNX Runtime, and by extension `ort`, supports a wide variety of platforms. For most desktop users, pre-built binaries are available, so setting up `ort` is as simple as adding it to your `Cargo.toml`!

Here are the supported platforms and binary availability status, as of v2.0.

* 🟢 - Supported. Dynamic & static binaries provided by pyke.

Remember that "Dynamic" linking means ONNX Runtime will come as a DLL or `.so` alongside your application. "Static" means ONNX Runtime is linked directly into your application in a single file. If available, `ort` will always prefer linking to static binaries over dynamic binaries.

Certain execution providers may not have binaries available. Most EPs only work with dynamic linking. You can check EP binary support in the [execution providers](/perf/execution-providers) documentation.

For platforms marked as 🟨, you'll need to [compile ONNX Runtime from source](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/).
